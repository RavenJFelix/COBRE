Introduction
============

COBRE is a c++ render engine library that facilitates the generation
of text based images for a wide variety of applications from console guis
to console based video games(with text-graphics instead of the mere
words)

Flexibility
-----------

COBRE is designed to be as extensible as possible which is why the core components
and basic widgets are uncoupled from NCurses. Instead, the output can be fed into
NCurses.

Building
--------

In order to build COBRE, you will need to use CMake.
There is an automated build script "build.sh" included for convenience.
