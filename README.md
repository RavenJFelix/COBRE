What is COBRE?
==============
Cobre is a text based render engine which allows programmers to not only
create text-based-graphical user interfaces but to create anything they need in general
from animations to video games.

## Doesn't Curses provide the functionality?
Curses provides built in __User interface__ functionality; COBRE goes beyond and allows
the creation of graphical video games with ease. It can interface with Curses in order to
display the frames to the console; however, it can be interfaced to anything, even directly
to a specific console environment.

In other words, COBRE is designed to be flexible. _(And a success in the end)_

Origins
-------
Imagine learning c++, you start learning about compilers, command line and the magic of vim and hear of something called
QT. However, QT for the most part requires the use of their IDE so out of rage you end up creating your own gui system. _Because bitch, I've got a nearly decades old laptop with a mere i3 processor._ 

Now do I use the firefox command to start browsing instead of using the quick menue? Sadly yes.
